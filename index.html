      <p> I occasionally taught a graduate Computer Science course on how to write papers and how to give talks. I publish a<a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/Cormen-rules.pdf"target="blank">list of usage rules </a>that I required my students to observe.</p>

        <h3><i>Introduction to Algorithms</i></h3>
        <p>Yes, I am coauthor of<i> Introduction to Algorithms</i>, along with Charles Leiserson, Ron Rivest, and Cliff Stein. For MIT Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a post on their blog about the secret to writing a best-selling textbook.</p>
        <p>Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about<i> Introduction to Algorithms:</i></p>
        <dl>
            <dt><i>Will there be a fourth edition? If so, when will it be available?</i></dt>
            <dd>The fourth edition was released on 5 April 2022. The MIT Press site for the book has links to sites that sell it</dd>
            <dt><i>Where can I find a list of errata?</i></dt>
            <dd>For the fourth edition, we maintain an errata page that allows you to list errors by date, by page, or by severity.</dd>
               <dd> For the second and third editions, we maintained an errata page that allows you to list errors by date, by page, by severity, or by discoverer. There is even an incremental update feature, allowing you to list only the errors posted since the last date that you asked about. We stopped logging errors for the third edition in January 2019 so that we could focus on preparing the fourth edition.</dd>
            <dt>How do I report errors?</dt>
            <dd>First, please visit the errata page to verify that the error has not been reported already. Once you have determined that you have found an unreported error, send email to clrs-bugs@mit.edu. We will respond as quickly as possible, often within a day.</dd>
               <dd> Please use the clrs-bugs@mit.edu address only to report errors. If you have a suggestion or a question, please contact me directly at thc@cs.dartmouth.edu.</dd>
